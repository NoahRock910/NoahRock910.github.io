        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my CV website.
           I liked the idea of making a website as a CV because a website has way cooler things then a sheet of paper,
           and I live by the rule of cool. I felt a website allowed for substantial more self-expression and creativity and I truly value that. 
           For definite throughout my life, I have always been a creative person and that’s not strictly just making projects but with how I tend to live.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Computer Science is akin to an outlet for me creatively. I possess a strong passion for problem solving and group environments. 
          Im convicted in my work ethic and the ability to quickly adapt and learn new skills, such as communication, independence and problem-solving. 
          I thrive in dynamic environments, enjoy taking on new challenges, and am always looking to evolve through continuous learning. 
          I am eager to contribute to a team where I can prove myself and grow professionally. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Im seeking employers who believe in their goals and pride themselves on their company culture and workplace environment. 
          Im seeking employment that will push me forward. Im seeking a place to prove myself in my work.
        </p>

      <div id="education" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Education</h2>

        <h4>Primary School: <a href="http://gaelscoilbhuncranncha.ie">Gaelscoil Bhun Cranncha</a></h4>
        <p>2009-2018</p>
        <p>I went to a "Gaelscoil" (A School whose primary language is Irish/Gaelige) as a child and I’m happy to say I’ve still retained the language. 
          My spelling has always been shoddy at best even with English but I’m very capable when it comes to actually speaking the language. 
          This is where my first introduction to coding came in via <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"> Scratch.</a> 
          I didn’t really care for it honestly. I enjoyed the actual process and idea of coding and I did understand it quickly.
          However, I wanted to use it as an outlet for my creative writing, and I found the software limiting with what extravagant ideas I had.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Secondary School: <a href="https://www.cranacollege.com/">Crana College</a></h4>
        <p>2018-2023</p>
        <p>I spent my teenage years developing in a school where the number of prefabs almost equalled the amount of actual classrooms. 
          It was a single-story Z shaped building and I always happened to get the worst lockers. For the leaving cert I choose computer science which was a new module only in its second year of operation. 
          It really clicked for me. Every class I was excited to go to and I thrived with the work. Our teacher was underqualified due to him teaching woodworking, technical graphics and then computer science all at leaving cert level. 
          His way of teaching was practically non-existent; It was more like individual learning than anything, this was not a bad thing, however. 
          I’d sit by myself with my headphones and crack out python or HTML exercises all day with my wired headphones on and that was blissful for me. 
          I was aiming for a H1 but sadly my project let me down to a H2 and that was a learning lesson for me.
          I learned that I needed to plan my projects better, focus on the requirements and not get carried away with my ideas.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Third Level: <a href="https://www.atu.ie/campus/donegal-letterkenny">ATU Donegal</a></h4>
        <p>2023-2026</p>
        <p>Student <a href="https://www.atu.ie/courses/bachelor-of-science-honours-computer-science">Bachelors in Computer Science (Honours)</a></p>
        <p>Due to my completion of the leaving cert computer science module, I was eligible to enrol in an accelerated course at ATU Donegal. 
          This course was cut down to three years while remaining a honours level degree. 
          Its a broad-based computing course which covers a full range of core topics including programming, databases, networking, machine learning, AI & data science and full team project creation. 
          We ran through numerous languages such as the basic python, java and html however we also covered MySQL, C and R. 
          We were also taught based on what was used in industry for example heavy emphasis was put on Agile and other iterative methodologies throughout the course. 
          For our final year we are assigned a individual project to deliver by the end of the year. 
          I am excited to do this as project work has always been a fun to me, especially if I feel invested into the project.

        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h4><a href="https://www.articad.com/supplier-partnership-andoras/">Andoras LTD:</a> Production Operative</h4>
        <p>JUN 2022 - SEPT 2022</p>
        <p>Operated a mechanical sander alongside another coworker. 
          According to the correct range and class of sheet, doors would need to be sanded at a certain precise height and a precise number of times before completion. 
          A wire brush machine was also operated if required in order sheet.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.articad.com/supplier-partnership-andoras/">Andoras LTD:</a> Production Operative</h4>
        <p>JUN 2023 - SEP 2023</p>
        <p>Used wood filler to finalize a bead within a wooden frame and provided other touching up details such as sanding coarse wood 
          and filling any damage sustained during its creation.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.articad.com/supplier-partnership-andoras/">Andoras LTD:</a> Production Operative</h4>
        <p>JUN 2024 - SEP 2024</p>
        <p>Operated independently with a hand sander on pallets of wooden doors before they were to be painted. 
          Managed a floor of pallets and effectively organized workload so what was needed was ready. 
          Quickly adapted to changes in order priority and consistently completed my workload efficiently.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.articad.com/supplier-partnership-andoras/">Andoras LTD:</a> Production Operative</h4>
        <p>JUN 2025 - SEP 2025</p>
        <p>Using a sanding bench and orbital hand sander, sanded down wood post spay paint, 
          taking care to mend any visible disfigurement or errors to the wood. 
          Worked consistent overtime amounting to 8 and a half hours of overtime almost every week.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>What I Gained From This</h3>
        <p>
          I worked hard in Andoras. The jobs were demanding and required not only strength 
          but a calm and focused mindset when deadline pressure weighed down. 
          Throughout the years I worked both independently and in a team which taugh me valuable skills. 
          I believe the most important thing I gained through the countless hours of work was a 
          strong and commited work ethic.
        </p>

      <div id="about" class="tab-content">
        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <h4>Birthday</h4>
        <p>
          I was born on the 10th of the 10th which is objectively a sick birthday! 
          <button onclick="calcDate()">That was in 2005 so I am now...</button>
        </p>
        <p id="age"></p>
        <br>

        <p>I’ve been born and raised in Buncrana, a small coastal town in Donegal which drives its name from being at the bottom of the cranna river. 
          It’s a beautiful scenic place and I’m really glad to have be raised here but I’m desperate to get out and be on my own. 
          I was content in my life to live and die in this small town, but I’ve changed and I crave the calling of the city. 
          I love having things to do and people to meet I think id enjoy all of the social aspects and definitely the night life. 
          Also, I’m seeking music venues that match more of my style, no harm to trad music it will forever remain in my heart 
          but they really aren’t the places to mosh.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Intrests</h4>

        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>I love music but never enough to study and I haven’t learned an instrument (yet, I will buy a drumkit someday). 
          I started off like most people by listening to embarrassing music and I’ve kept that up till today and probably till death. 
          My first real music artist I was a fan of was Tyler, the creator (Explains the background music). 
          I remember the night I listened to his album flowerboy very fondly, it was also the first album I ever listened to. 
          My music journey continued with more artists and albums but I’ve only recently started attending live shows which I neglected so much. 
          I’ve gone through many genres throughout my music journey and currently I’m enjoying hardcore and post-hardcore punk rock music. 
          <button id="errorzone-btn" onclick="toggleErrorZone()">Enter the Errorzone</button>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Combat Sports</h4>
        <p>I’ve always been a wee scraper as a kid, 
          I grew up with a lot of cousins and brothers and we made pivotal bonding moments while trying to tip each other over. 
          I took to a karate judo hybrid as a child in between football training and I really found myself thriving, 
          not only with the techniques but socially. 
          I not only bonded with other people there but I really put effort in to be patient and help those around me.
          On my first competition I took home 2 trophies and skipped an entire belt grading 
          (only a junior belt skip) and it would seem I found a real hobby that I cared about. 
          It makes it all the more confusing I stopped. 
          I know at the time I hated football but dropping that was out of the question. 
          Honestly, I think I settled to just play videogames instead all day instead.
          I was always a chubby kid but I did get fat over covid despite my pitiful home workout attempts. 
          At 15 I joined a local boxing club and it might’ve changed my life. 
          I burned through so much fat and earned a newfound confidence in myself. 
          However, I could never feel entirely comfortable with sparring and sparring culture. 
          Egos sometimes were brought into the ring and that was never fun. 
          I stopped boxing and it wasn’t until the start of my second year of uni where my relationship with BJJ and MMA began.
          I started off in the Gi which quickly turned into attending no Gi classes and then snowballed into attending every class I could make for a while.
          Sadly, final year has come and I had to drop the sport in order to meet its demands. I can’t wait to start again if I ever get my free time back.
          Im forever grateful for the sport and the confidence it instilled in me.

        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Creative Writting</h4>
        <p>We had a creative writing class in fourth class once a week and that was absolutely a time for me to shine. 
          We'd read out our finished works to the class and id do so eagerly. 
          Through this I became confident with presenting and learned to love it.  </p>
        <br>

        <h4>App Creation</h4>
        <p>My favourite parts of Computer Science have been mixing the code with my creativity. 
          I adore working on my own projects I find it so rewarding to turn my visions into a tangible product. 
          I motivate myself to achieve my goals and I believe that’s a crucial part of my strong work ethic. 
          I love the entire process of app creation from the initial idea, to the planning, to the coding and finally the testing and deployment.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Video Production</h4>
        <p>I used to have a dumb little TikTok page with my friends. 
          It’s gone now but the enjoyment I got out of creating, planning and performing stuck with me. 
          It’s a hobby I never really had the time to pursue unfortunately however I do have a real appreciation for it.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Video Games</h4>
        <p>I love video games they are so apart of who I am as a person. 
          As far as I can remember ive been playing video games, 
          the ps2 was my first ever console I spent time with playing games like Jak and Daxter and The Prince Of Persia: Warrior Within, 
          (I should not have been playing Warrior Within at five years old, this is a link to the first boss of the game <a href="https://princeofpersia.fandom.com/wiki/Shahdee">Shahdee </a>).</s> 
          I did grow up with a lot of Nintendo games too, I loved the Mario games I remember having so much Mario iconography in my room, he was actually apart of it since he was painted on my wall.
          Down below are three of my favourite games of all time and a breif explanation of why.
        </p>

           <div class="carousel-slide">

               <h4 id="game-title">Red Dead Redemption 2</h4>
               <p id="game-desc">
                What a world. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, the graphics, the music, the gameplay; the game is not perfect but the impact it had one me is unmatched by any other game. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite game of all time. I've played it three times and even 100% precented it (Never again).

        <br>

        <h3>Traits</h3>
        
        <h4>Adaptable</h4>
        <p>In my life I’ve come to find myself more adaptable than others. 
          Whether its plans changing or new tools and processes being introduced. 
          I'm always keen to look ahead to what can be done and I never linger on the past.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Independent</h4>
        <p>I enjoy the process of working on my own.
           I hold myself responsible and find myself really getting in the zone.
           As someone who likes to write I’ve learned a lot through the process and I can apply such lessons into my work ethic.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
        <p>I find problem solving and even problem obsession to be highly entertaining, 
          even with the immense frustration that is bound to tough issues. 
          The satisfaction of a working solution is quite a peak of programming.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Team Player</h4>
        <p>I really gain a lot from teamwork. 
          I thrive in a team environment, and I strive to uplift my team and communicate effectively. 
          I’m very quick to find my footing and with the right team I can really push myself to do my best work.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Organised</h4>
        <p>
          I like to keep my workspace and my mind clear. 
          I find that being organised helps me focus and be more productive. 
          I’m always eager to keep my tasks and goals in order so I can tackle them efficiently.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Creative</h4>
        <p>
          I absolutely pride myself on my creative thinking. It’s a core part of who I am. 
          I love to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions. 
          It’s a blessing in my work and in my life. 
          Thats why I love computer science so much.
          It allows me to express my creativity in a technical way. 
          Thats why I love making apps, websites and projects.
        </p>
